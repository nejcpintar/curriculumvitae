# What is this?
This is a program that outputs my CV

#But, I just want to see your CV
If you're a developer, want to review my coding style and have the latest XCode installed, you can just clone and build the project. Otherwise, here's a formatted copy of the output:

##Nejc Pintar

I've been wanting to work with computers since I was a little kid. I've jumped into development at the age of 15 and during high school, I have already occasionally worked as an intern at Metalab d.o.o. I'm passionate about my work and hobbies, always trying to bring anything I do to the highest possible level. When not working I try to challenge my body and mind with hobbies and sports like CAD, 3D printing, skiing and downhill skateboarding.

##Education:
Studied program of Technical Gymnasium at Technical School Center Kranj from 2004 to 2008
Studied program of Computer Science and IT at University Of Maribor from 2008 to 2010 (non-graduate)

##Previous work:
### Worked as an iOS Developer at Thirdlove from 2016 to 2017
I worked part-time and remotely for Thirdlove as their lead iOS developer. My work there consisted mainly of maintenance and development of their e-commerce iOS app and their bra sizing technology. I learned to work with Shopify, Parse, Facebook SDK and Fabric thoroughly while doing this project.

### Worked as an iOS Developer at Toonia from 2013 to 2016
Working at Toonia has had the most influence on the way I think and work. Besides learning development for iOS, I also learned a lot about user experience, psychology and graphics. Most of the work there was about creating tailor-made, fluid user interfaces suitable for kids. We relied on vector graphics a lot, which also meant a lot of work on rendering engines and curve manipulation.
Here are the examples of my work there:

### Worked as an Qt Developer at Toshl from 2011 to 2012
I tipped my toes into the world of mobile development at Toshl. I developed and maintained apps for Symbian and Meego there.
